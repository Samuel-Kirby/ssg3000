# ssg3000
A homemade static site generator

## Notes

The **marked.parse** method does not accept file input, it must be passed a string containing markdown.

## To Do

- Create a function which opens markdown files and saves their contents as string variables

- Create a function which accepts markdown strings and processes them into html

- Create a function which reads an html template file

- Create a function which stiches together html from template files and the parser
